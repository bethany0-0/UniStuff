The administrator of a popular cricketing website was recently updating images on their homepage. During the updates, they accidentally uploaded an image we believe may help the England squad continue their domination of the sport. Unfortunately, the image is encrypted. We do still have a copy of the image that was replaced, if it's any help.

He will have used a strong encryption key and we don't have time to brute-force it, but we're not sure what encryption mode he's used. He does seem pretty obsessed with the English Cricket Board!

Is there any way you can get the information we need?
